## Reading research papers

if you are a PhD. student you learn it the hard way.

for eg. speech recognition model:

1. couple list of papers (academic and blog post)
2. skip around papers (iterate through papers and understand 10% of them)
3. focus on the one that is similar to you

### how to read a paper

multiple passes 

1. title / abstract / figures
2. intro / conclusions + figures + skim rest (skim related work section)
3. read paper skip/skim math
4. whole thing (skip the things that doesn't make sense)

you should able to answer these questions after reading a paper

- what did authors try to accomplish?

- what were the key elements of the approach?

- what can you use yourself

- what references you want to follow

### Sources of papers

- Twitter 
- ML sub reddit
- NIPS / ICML / ICLR
- friends and colleagues

### Math

- rederive from the scratch (by doing this you can do your math of you idea)

### Code

- run code from the GitHub
- re implement from scratch

2/3 papers of a week for a year better than 200 paper on 3 month. 

## Navigating career 

you can do this two:

- Job (big company or startup)
- PhD

### How to get the position 

- skills (ML, quiz, coding)
- meaningful work
  - can do work
  - projects - research - internship - open source contibs
  - 1/2 great projects is better than 10 small projects

projects will help you with the depth of your knowledge 

course work and reading will help you with the width of your knowledge 

### search positions

work with great people / projects (we get influenced by people around us)

- focus on the team you'll interact with (10 - 30 people)
- manager 
- not on the "brand"
