# **Lec3** (Full cycle DL):

what you need to do for a project

- steps of serious ML apps:
  - select the problem(supervised) (case voice activation) gets an audio and 0/1 to if it contains the target word
  - get data
  - design model
  - train model
  - test model
  - QA (continuous)
  - deploy
  - maintain
- we talk about QA .(continuous)deploy . maintain and select the problem
- we need 2 target words.
- list of 5 bullet points for a success DL
  - project
  - Data
  - Interest
  - Domain Knowledge 
  - Utility 
  - Feasibility
- Get data (how many days and how you do collect?)
  - 1,2 days get data
  - it's difficult to know what is hard about the problem
- keep clear notes on experiments you ran. or have spreadsheet that what worked.
- number 6 - deployment
  - large neural net
  - lots of process on edge devices in contrast to clouds
  - Voice activity detection (VAD) . if there is any audio then encode it.
    - Non-ml, see if value > epsilon (do this because it's faster)
    - train small neural net in human speech
    - when ship the product the data changes
      - accent for eg.
      - different back ground noise
      - new mic 
- 7 maintain
  -  the world changes and you need to maintain
    - web search changes
    - self driving car (light changes)
    - inspection
  - edge / cloud
    - does a cloud or edge deployment make maintenance easier, and why?
      - cloud / detect the problem faster
